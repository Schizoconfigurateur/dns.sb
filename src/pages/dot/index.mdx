# Using DNS over TLS at DNS.SB

## What is DNS over TLS

DNS over TLS (DoT) is a security protocol for encrypting and authenticating communications between DNS clients and servers. The goal of the protocol is to provide privacy and integrity for DNS queries and responses, by encrypting the query and response payloads and by providing authentication of the DNS server's identity. DNS over TLS is designed to operate over port 853, which is separate from the traditional DNS port (53). This allows it to be easily deployed in parallel with an existing DNS infrastructure, while providing an additional layer of security.

## Our DoT Servers

*No Logging, DNSSEC enabled*

### Hostname for TLS Authentication

```
dot.sb
```

### TLS Port

- `853`

### IPv4

```
185.222.222.222
```

```
45.11.45.11
```

### IPv6

```
2a09::
```

```
2a11::
```

<Callout type="warning">
When using IPv6 address, you must use specific hostname `dot.sb`
</Callout>

### IPv6 with Full Address

```
2a09:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000
```

```
2a11:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000
```

### PEM / CRT File

[dns.sb.crt](https://github.com/dns-sb/DoT/blob/master/cert/dns.sb.crt)

### SPKI Pin

```
0Ot+uUBCfWZkE2GFQQcIpR9GmuhWioGEl+K11FhNmHk=
```
You can generate and verify SPKI PIN with the following command:

```bash
echo | openssl s_client -connect 185.222.222.222:853 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -pubkey -noout | openssl pkey -pubin -outform der | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | openssl enc -base64
```

## Example Configurations

### Unbound
